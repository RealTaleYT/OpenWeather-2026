## Oper Wetather web application
Welcome to my website where you can use it to watch the weather of a city or youre location.\
You can also change the language of the weather on the top right of the screen.
To run the web version you need to install Ionic:
```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```
Once you install ionic and the project, if you want to use the web version, you have to use this command:
```bash
ionic serve
```
If u want to use the mobile version, you need android studio([https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=es-419](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=es-419)) and a mobile phone (phisic or emulated)
once u have this, use the command: 
```bash
ionic cap run android
```
And the last thing is press the run button.
